This is an entry for [GBJam-11](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-11), you can find the game page [here](https://baobeld.itch.io/cowpocalypse).

# Themes 
The theme for this GameJam was Gameboy, your display was limited to 160x144 pixels and you were only allowed to use 4 colors (yes shades count as colors, so does white... so does black...) with a second theme of "Space".

# Gameplay
The goal of the game is to abduct cows to increase your score before time runs out, abducting cows has the added benefit of extending your timer so you can play longer (and this rack up a higher score!). 

But watch out for farmers! They don't appreciate you stealing their cows and will throw pitchforks to slow you down (oh no!).
